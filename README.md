# 15-Tile-Puzzle-Solver
Implemented the GRAPH-SEARCH Algorithm with A* Search Strategy for solving the 15-puzzle problem

## 15-puzzle problem:
  On a 4 x 4 board there are 15 tiles numbered from 1 to 15 and a blank position. <br/>
  A tile can slide into the blank position if it is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the blank position.<br/><br/>
  Given a start board configuration and a goal board configuration, a sequence of moves to reach the goal configuration from the start configuration was found. The goal is to find a solution with minimum number of moves.
